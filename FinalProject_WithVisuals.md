## Research Question

How does food access, in terms of SNAP participation, vehicle availability, and racial demographics, vary across U.S. census tracts, and what disparities emerge for predominantly Black communities?

---

## Problem Statement

Food deserts and limited food access remain major barriers to health equity. This project investigates how systemic racial and economic factors influence food access across communities using national tract-level data.

---

## Data Description

- **Source:** USDA Food Access Research Atlas
- **Key Features:**
  - SNAP participation
  - Elderly populations (TractSeniors)
  - Households without vehicles (TractHUNV)
  - Percent Black/White populations
  - Low-Income and Low-Access indicators

## Conclusion

The analysis confirms that predominantly Black communities face disproportionate barriers to food access, with higher reliance on SNAP, fewer household vehicles, and greater proximity to food deserts. Data-driven interventions must address these structural disparities to promote equitable access to nutritious foods.
